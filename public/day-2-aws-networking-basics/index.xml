      <description>AWS currently has 24 regions in its global infrastructure. A region is a physical location around the world where data centers are clustered. These data centers are grouped in Availability Zones. Each of these regions contains at least two Availability Zones. There are 77 Availability Zones.
AWS is responsible of protecting this infrastructure according to the Shared Responsibility Model:</description>

      <title>What is a VPC?</title>

      <description>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) allows you to provision resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into a virtual network. This virtual network is a logically isolated area within the AWS cloud that resembles a traditional network. Think about it as a private data center in the cloud.
The VPC is highly available as it spans all of the Availability Zones in the Region where you launch it. When you create a VPC, you provide a CIDR block that specifies the range of IP addresses for the VPC.</description>

      <title>Private/Public concepts</title>

      <description>Resources launched inside a VPC will take an IP address from the CIDR block assigned. For example, for a 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR block, an EC2 instance could have 10.0.0.42 as its IP address.
This IP address is private: it only makes sense inside the VPC and can&amp;rsquo;t be reached from the Internet. In order to make the EC2 instance publicly reachable, two conditions must be fulfilled: the EC2 instance must have a public IP address and an Internet Gateway attached to the VPC.</description>

      <description>ACLs and SGs.
A security group is a virtual stateful firewall that controls inbound and outbound network traffic to AWS resources and Amazon EC2 instances. At AWS, security groups act like a built-in firewall for your virtual servers. With these security groups, you have full control about how accessible your instances are. At the most basic level, it is just another method to filter traffic to your instances. It provides you control about what traffic to allow or deny.</description>
