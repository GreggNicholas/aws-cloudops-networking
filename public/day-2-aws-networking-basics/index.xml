      <description>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) allows you to provision resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into a virtual network. This virtual network is a logically isolated area within the AWS cloud that resembles a traditional network. Think about it as a private data center in the cloud.
The VPC is highly available as it spans all of the Availability Zones in the Region where you launch it. When you create a VPC, you provide a CIDR block that specifies the range of IP addresses for the VPC.</description>
