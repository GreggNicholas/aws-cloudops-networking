	"content": "A network can be defined as a group of devices interconnected together via an edge networking component forming a dedicated and private environment.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take an example:\nThere are several types of networks but the most common are LAN (Local Area Network) and WAN (Wide Area Network). As the names indicate, a LAN is defined by a single network (i.e. your house network) while a WAN allows interconnection between different LANs.\nHow does it work?\nThe main devices used in networking are switch and router. They work at different layers and allow connectivity inside and outside a network, respectively.\nIn a LAN, a switch allows all devices in its network to connect and communicate. The router sits on the edge of the LAN in order to provide external connectivity, either to the Internet or to an external network.\nIn a WAN, edge routers of the different LANs connect together to allow their inside LAN to talk to each other. And all of this is done thanks to routing and IP addressing that we will cover in a few sections.\nNow that we have the big picture, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about networking layers.\n"

	"content": "All networking concepts are based on the OSI model:\nEach layer has a meaning in networking. We will not cover the layers in dept, but you can read more about in the Further Reading section.\nNetworking is based on the OSI model, it is a bit like the layers of a cake, often referred as L1, L2, L3, etc..\nLet\u0026rsquo;s pick some real life examples:\n  L1 = your home router, your cables\n  L2 = your home devices interconnecting (find example)\n  L3 = your home laptop/phone getting to the Internet\n  L4 = when you stream an online movie\n  L5 = when you download a file\n  L6 = when you used Putty to login to your EC2 instance during Linux CloudOps workshop\n  L7 = a website\n  (TO SPEECH)\nL1 corresponds to anything physical, such as a device or a cable. If we go back to our chat about routers and switches, the devices as such will sit in L1 since they are physical.\nHowever, although they\u0026rsquo;re physical machines, they provide functionalities corresponding to other layers. A switch does not do any routing, meaning it does not know what is an IP address, and only work out connectivity inside a LAN. So a switch, in it is logical way, will sit in L2 Data layer.\nOn the other hand, a router allows routing and communication between different networks via IP adressing, so it works at the L3 Network layer.\nL4 corresponds to anything (protocols or devices) related to transport of data across the network. (Can be firewall against L4 attacks, or examples of UDP streaming or TCP).\nWhen we talk about API or establishing an end to end path to send data, we refer to L5 Session layer.\nL6 Presentation layer for example SSH to login to instance, or SSL whe we check this small lock near the HTTP of the website we\u0026rsquo;re on.\nTo finish, L7 is the website, the DNS protocol to resolve the webiste, etc.\n"

	"content": "A network (or LAN) is defined by a a block of IP addresses called a CIDR block, from which every machine in the network receives an IP address.\nPICTURE\nCIDR have the purpose of sizing and seggregating networks. If you have a small home network, you will only need a few IP adresses, therefore the CIDR should be small, but if you work in a company where plenty of devices need to connect, and therefore require an IP address, then the size needs to be bigger.\nHow is a CIDR calculated?\nthe full lenght of an IP address is 32 bits.\nIP addresses are written in binaries and translated into numbers called octets, so each number representing 8 bits.\nThis is segmented in 2 parts : the subnet ID (always the left part), and the network ID (always on the right).\nThe subnet mask defines the size of your network, the network part defines the number of IP addresses (called hosts) that you can use in your network.\nA subnet is calculated from right to left, as below:\n255 is the maximum number you can have over an octet, therefore the subnet mask covers the full lenght, giving no space for IP address use. As a result, the subnet mask is /32, the maximum size in an IP address.\nA few examples:\nShow IP address on ipconfig laptop.\nTutorial: https://acloud.guru/overview/124ee946-2249-40c2-a664-aa26af523920?_ga=2.78699287.2097752874.1606729826-1802322676.1602598892\n"
