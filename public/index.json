	"content": "A network can be defined as a group of devices interconnected together via an edge networking component forming a dedicated and private environment.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take an example:\nThere are several types of networks but the most common are LAN (Local Area Network) and WAN (Wide Area Network). As the names indicate, a LAN is defined by a single network (i.e. your house network) while a WAN allows interconnection between different LANs.\nThe main devices used in networking are switch and router. They work at different layers and allow connectivity inside and outside a network, respectively.\nThe main difference is that a switch communicates with MAC addresses (a unique physical ID) while a router communicates with IP addresses, and the main difference between a MAC and an IP is that it works at different network layers and a MAC is a static physical ID that cannot be changed while an IP can be allocated anc changed anytime.\nThe switch allows all devices in the network/LAN to communicate while the router sits on the edge of the LAN in order to provide external connectivity, either to the Internet or to another network/LAN.\nWhen a host sends traffic to another host, the traffic is made of packets. Those packets contain information about the traffic to be sent, including the source and destination MAC address and IP address.\nSo when the traffic remains local, the switch can transfer the packet to its destination host by reading the MAC address in the packet. However, when the traffic is destined to an external host, the network is different and therefore the switch doesn\u0026rsquo;t know where to send the packet. That\u0026rsquo;s when comes the role of the router, to pick up the packet, and checks its route table to know where to transfer the traffic.\nSo, a switch will allow intra-LAN connectivity, a router will allow inter-LAN connectivity.\nA router is attached to a network via a network interface with a static IP address that belongs to that network. It can have different interfaces with different IP addresses, therefore belonging to different networks at the same time. In that case, the router doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to communicate with another router to reach another network, the routing is done internally.\nThe router IP address is called a Gateway IP, meaning it is the door via which all traffic is going, when a network host is trying to reach an external IP/host.\nIn real life, there are also devices that combine switch and router together, therefore can ensure both types of communication.\nIn a WAN, edge routers of the different LANs (refer to Example 2 above) route traffic to each other to allow communication between the different networks.\nNow that we have the big picture, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about networking layers.\n"

	"content": "Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) allows you to provision resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into a virtual network. This virtual network is a logically isolated area within the AWS cloud that resembles a traditional network. Think about it as a private data center in the cloud.\nThe VPC is highly available as it spans all of the Availability Zones in the Region where you launch it. When you create a VPC, you provide a CIDR block that specifies the range of IP addresses for the VPC. For example, 10.0.0.0/16.\nA VPC can contain multiple subnets where you can launch AWS resources. Each subnet will reside in one Availability Zone and you can have multiple subnets in the same Availability zone.\nYou must specify a CIDR block for the subnets from the range of your VPC. For example, 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.1.0/24. If you launch an EC2 instance inside the first subnet, it will have an IP address inside the 10.0.0.0/24 range (for example, 10.0.0.42).\nThe VPC has an implicit router that uses route tables to direct traffic. Each subnet is associated with a route table that controls the routing for that particular subnet. If you don\u0026rsquo;t associate explicitly a subnet with a particular route table, it will be implicitly associated with the main route table:\n   Destination Target     10.0.0.0/16 local    Multiple subnets can be associated with the same route table. However, you can only associate a subnet with one route table, except for the default (or main) route table that is automatically generated at the VPC creation.\nAs we discussed in Traditional Networking, the first IP and the last IP of a CIDR are reserved for Network ID and Broadcast respectively. AWS reserves 5 IPs by default within each subnet:\n the first IP : Network ID the second IP : VPC router (referred as the router gateway in traditional networking) the third IP : DNS resolver the fourth IP : reserved for future use the last IP : broadcast address  So, if our subnet is 10.10.1.0/24, the following IPs will be reserved:\n 10.10.0.0 10.10.1.1 10.10.1.2 10.10.1.3 10.10.1.255  In AWS, the maximum size of a CIDR is /16 and the minimum size is /28, which means:\n/28 = 1111 1111.1111 1111.1111 1111.1111 0000 = 255.255.255.240\n255 - 240 = 15\nBecause a network starts from .0 (.0 to .15), there are 16 addresses in a /28. However, we need to remove the 5 reserved IPs, therefore it gives us 11 IPs available for use. That means that if you need more than 11 IPs in your network, you will need to have a bigger CIDR such as /27 or above.\nLab 1:\n Login to your AWS account Go to VPC Services and on the left panel, click on Your VPCs Click on Create VPC and give it a name (i.e. VPC-\u0026ldquo;Your Initials\u0026rdquo;) and a /16 CIDR block (i.e. 10.10.0.0/16), then leave the rest as default and click Create VPC Go back to the Your VPCs tab and check that your VPC has been created  "

	"content": "Resources launched inside a VPC will be assigned an IP address from the CIDR block assigned. For example, for a 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR block, an EC2 instance could have 10.0.0.42 as its IP address, depending on which subnet it lives in.\nAll IPs inside that VPC CIDR block are private : they only make sense inside that VPC and cannot be reached from the Internet or from any other network/VPC unless the routing has been setup accordingly. In order to make an EC2 instance publicly reachable, two conditions must be fulfilled:\n the EC2 instance must have a public IP address an Internet Gateway must be attached to its VPC route table  An Internet Gateway is a highly available component that brings connectivity to your VPC, allowing access to the Internet. Your public resources must reside in a subnet that\u0026rsquo;s associated with a route table that has a route to an Internet Gateway. This subnet is called a public subnet.\nA private subnet, on the other hand, is associated with a route table that does not have a route to an Internet Gateway. The resources that should remain private, reside in these subnets. However, it can happen that some private resources need access to the Internet to download some software, but while remaining unaccessible from the Internet. In this case, you can configure a NAT Gateway to allow egress Internet access from the private instances.\nThe NAT Gateway allow your EC2 instance to connect to the Internet, but prevent the Internet from connecting to it. The NAT Gateway resides in a public subnet in a certain Availability Zone. In order to allow your private subnets to use the NAT Gateway to connect to the Internet, you must add it to the route tables they are associated with. Note that a NAT Gateway still needs an Internet Gateway to access the Internet. The NAT is only present to proxy the Internet traffic for the private instances, but the Internet Gateway remains the main and only Internet exit gate for a VPC.\nNote that all subnets in a VPC, regardless of being public or private, can communicate with each other by default because they belong to the same VPC CIDR. This is not a traditional networking use case, but in AWS, when the VPC gets created, all route tables are assigned a route to the VPC CIDR.\nLab 2:\nCreate a public subnet:\n Go to VPC Services and on the left panel, click on Subnets Click on Create Subnet  give it a name (PublicSub-\u0026ldquo;Your Initials\u0026rdquo;) choose your VPC from the list choose one of the Availability Zones Use the first /24 of your VPC CIDR (i.e. 10.10.0.0/24) Click Create Subnet    Now, your subnet is setup but can only communicate within the VPC by default.\n In the VPC Services tab, click on Route Tables Click on Create Route Table  give it a name (PublicRT-\u0026ldquo;Your Initials\u0026rdquo;) choose your VPC from the list Click Create   On the Route Tables interface, look for your route table:  select the route table on the panel at the bottom, click on Subnet Associations Edit subnet associations and select your public subnet and Save    Now, you have a public route table that will be used to route all external (such as Internet) traffic to and from your public subnet. However, we still don\u0026rsquo;t know how to go to the Internet as we have no exit door yet.\n In the VPC Services tab, click on Internet Gateways Click on Create Internet Gateway  give it a name (IGW-\u0026ldquo;Your Initials\u0026rdquo;) and Create   Once it is created, you should be on its configuration page:  click Actions and select Attach to VPC select your VPC and Attach    Now, your Internet Gateway belongs to your VPC environment, so we can set it up to route all Internet traffic.\n In the VPC Services tab, click on Route Tables On the Route Tables interface, look for your public route table:  select the public route table on the panel at the bottom, click on Routes then Edit routes Click Add route, set the following:  Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 (0/0 means everywhere, it is not restricted to a specific network) Target: Select Internet Gateway from the drop-down and click on your IGW-XXXX   Save the changes    Now, you have a public subnet! In a few sections, we will setup an EC2 instance, called public instance as a result of sitting in a public subnet, and test connectivity to the Internet.\nCreate a private subnet:\n Go to VPC Services and on the left panel, click on Subnets Click on Create Subnet  give it a name (PrivateSub-\u0026ldquo;Your Initials\u0026rdquo;) choose your VPC from the list choose one of the Availability Zones Use the second /24 of your VPC CIDR (i.e. 10.10.1.0/24) Click Create Subnet    Now, your subnet is setup but can only communicate within the VPC by default.\n In the VPC Services tab, click on Route Tables Click on Create Route Table  give it a name (PrivateRT-\u0026ldquo;Your Initials\u0026rdquo;) choose your VPC from the list Click Create   On the Route Tables interface, look for your route table:  select the route table on the panel at the bottom, click on Subnet Associations Edit subnet associations and select your private subnet and Save    Now, you have a private route table that will be used to route internal traffic. At the moment, we are unable to reach the Internet since we have no NAT Gateway.\n In the VPC Services tab, click on NAT Gateways Click on Create NAT Gateway  give it a name (NGW-\u0026ldquo;Your Initials\u0026rdquo;) and Create select your public subnet (We choose the public subnet just to configure the NAT, since a NAT is a public instance) click Allocate Elastic IP and Create    Now, your NAT Gateway belongs to your VPC environment because it is setup in its public subnet. It is therefore ready to be setup and used by the private subnet.\n In the VPC Services tab, click on Route Tables On the Route Tables interface, look for your private route table:  select the private route table on the panel at the bottom, click on Routes then Edit routes Click Add route, set the following:  Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 (0/0 means everywhere, it is not restricted to a specific network) Target: Select NAT Gateway from the drop-down and click on your NGW-XXXX   Save the changes    Now, you have a private subnet with outbound access to the Internet. In the next section, we will setup an EC2 instance, called private instance as a result of sitting in a private subnet, and test outbound connectivity to the Internet.\n"

	"content": "A security group is a virtual stateful firewall that controls inbound and outbound network traffic to AWS resources and Amazon EC2 instances. At AWS, security groups act like a built-in firewall for your virtual servers. With these security groups, you have full control about how accessible your instances are. At the most basic level, it is just another method to filter traffic to your instances. It provides you control about what traffic to allow or deny. To determine who has access to your instances, you configure a security group rule. Rules can vary from keeping the instance completely private, completely public, or somewhere in between. When you first configure a Security Group, all access is denied, so you need to add rules to allow traffic to flow. Security Groups are stateful, that means that anything that you allow to flow out of your instance and allowed by default to flow back in your instance.\nA Network access control list (network ACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. When you first configure a Network ACL, all access is allowed by default. NACL are stateless, that means that if you want to allow a type of traffic, you need to do it both for inbound and outbound.\nIn summary, the Network ACL acts at the subnet level. The Security Groups acts at the instance level.\nLab 3:\nCreate a public instance:\n Go to EC2 Services and click on Launch Instance  select the 1st Amazon Linux AMI from the list leave the Instance type as default and click Next Set the below:  Network: choose your VPC Subnet: choose your public subnet Auto-assign Public IP: Select Enable Leave the rest as default and go to the next page   Leave Storage as default and go to the next page In Tags, create a tag with Key : Name and Value : PublicEC2-\u0026ldquo;YourInitials\u0026rdquo; Leave the security group as default In the Review and Launch page, click Launch and select your KP that you created and stored locally during the Linux course    Let it spin up, and create your private instance in the meantime.\nCreate a private instance:\n Go to EC2 Services and click on Launch Instance  select the 1st Amazon Linux AMI from the list leave the Instance type as default and click Next Set the below:  Network: choose your VPC Subnet: choose your private subnet Auto-assign Public IP: Select Disable Leave the rest as default and go to the next page   Leave Storage as default and go to the next page In Tags, create a tag with Key : Name and Value : PrivateEC2-\u0026ldquo;YourInitials\u0026rdquo; Leave the security group as default In the Review and Launch page, click Launch and select your KP that you created and stored locally during the Linux course    Now you should have 1 public instance and 1 private instance. In the EC2 interface, if you select them one by one and look at the bottom panel, you should see all details about the instances. Notice that your public EC2 has a public IPv4 address as well as a public DNS name, on the opposite of the private EC2 that only has private addresses.\n On the public EC2 bottom panel, select the Security tab. The only rule allowed is SSH on port 22 from anywhere (o.o.o.o/0). Even if we want this instance to be publicly reachable, we do not want everyone to SSH into it and change configuration. Click on the Security Group and Edit Inbound rules  set the Source as My IP and in parallel, verify that it matches your IP address by typing whatsmyip in another browser tab Add a new rule with Type as All ICMP - IPv4 and Source as your IP again Save rules    Now that we have SSH and ICMP traffic allowed from our IP address, it means only you will be able to connect on those ports to the instance.\nWe will not be using NACL today as it is not required in this context, but you can have a look at the default one by going to VPC Services -\u0026gt; Subnets -\u0026gt; Network ACL (bottom panel).\nYou can now:\n open a terminal window and ping the public IP address of your instance ( ping X.X.X.X ) use SSH to login to your instance  We cannot do the same with the private instance since there is no public IP, you can try to SSH to its private IP to prove that it is not reachable. A way to SSH into it would be to setup a Bastion instance. This instance is a public instance that just acts as a jump box in order to connect to private instances securely. Despite being public, this instance would also have a private IP address belonging to that same VPC, therefore routable to the private subnet of the private instance.\n"

	"content": "A network (or LAN) is defined by a a block of IP addresses called a CIDR block, from which every host in the network receives an IP address.\nA CIDR indicates the size of a network, and networks are calculated with subnetting. Subnetting allows the segmentation of a bigger network in smaller networks. For example, a company could have different departments (HR, Finances, etc) and therefore wish to seggregate their corporate network based on these departments. So, each department will be allocated a portion of the big network (CIDR).\n Anatomy of a an IP address:  An IP address is made of 4 octets, 1 octet equals to 8 bits. So the maximum lenght of an IP address is 32 bits.\nIP addresses are translated from binaries, so each number represents an octet and an octet ranges from 0 to 255.\nExample:\n0000 0000 = 0\n1111 1111 = 255\n=\u0026gt; 1111 1111.1111 1111.1111 1111.1111 1111 = 255.255.255.255\nHow is this calculated?\nEach bit is a power of 2 (X^2) and is calculated from right to left.\nExample:\n192.168.1.0 =\u0026gt; 1100 0000.1010 1000.0000 0001.0000 0000\n Subnet Masks  An IP address is segmented in 2 parts :\n The Network section (always the left part) The Host section (always on the right).  The Host section defines the number of IPs available in a network. The Network section remains the same for all the hosts in a same network, ad is called the Network ID.\nExample:\nNetwork: 10.1.1.0/24\nHost 1: 10.1.1.1\nHost 2: 10.1.1.2\nHost 3: 10.1.1.4\nThe /24 is called the subnet mask and determines which parts of the IP are the network portion and the host portion.\n/24 represents 24 bits:\n1111 1111.1111 1111.1111 1111.0000 0000 = 255.255.255.0\n2552.255.255 = network section\n0 = host section\nGoing back to the previous example:\n10.1.1.0/24 = 10.1.1.0/255.255.255.0\nSo, the network ID is 10.1.1.0, and hosts can only be allocated in the .0 octet.\nExamples:\nExample 1:\n192.168.0.0/16 = 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0\nNetwork ID = 192.168.0.0\nHost range = 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255\nExample 2 :\n192.168.128.0/17 = 192.168.128.0/255.255.128.0\nNetwork ID = 192.168.128.0\nHost range = 192.168.128.0 - 192.168.255.255\nThe host range allows to calculate the number of hosts you can have in the network. The way to calculate is as follow: 2^(Nb of host bits).\nExample:\n 192.168.0.0/16 has 16 host bits so 2^16 = 65536 hosts 10.1.1.0/24 has 8 host bits so 2^8 = 256 hosts  So, the smaller the network portion is, the more hosts you can allocate.\nSo, as we talked about segmenting big networks into smaller networks, we can divide big CIDR into small CIDR.\nHow to calculate?\n/16 = 16 bits = 2^16 65536 hosts\n/24 = 8 bits = 2^8 = 256 hosts\n= 65536/256 = 256\nSo there are 256 /24 subnets in a /16 subnet.\n/24 = 8 bits = 2^8 = 256 hosts\n/25 = 7 bits = 2^7 = 128 hosts\n= 256/128 = 2\nSo there are 2 /25 subnets in a /24 subnet.\nOne last thing to remember is that there are always 2 IP addresses that cannot be used within a subnet:\n The first IP (10.1.1.0 if the subnet is 10.1.1.0/24) since it is reserved for the Network ID The last IP (10.1.1.255 if the subnet is 10.1.1.0/24) since it is reserved for the Broadcast IP. The broadcast IP is the IP used within a network to send messages to everyone in the network.  Not always but in most cases, as a best practice, the second IP of a subnet is dedicated to the router interface, called the Gateway IP. The gateway IP will be 10.1.1.1.1 if the subnet is 10.1.1.0/24.\nExercise:\n 10.20.3.2/24  What is the binary address of 10.20.3.2?\nWhat is the network ID?\nWhat is the subnet mask?\nWhat is the gateway router IP address?\nHow many IP addresses in this network?\n"

This enables you to achieve higher levels of fault tolerance with your applications.\nThere are currently 3 types of a load balancer:\n• Application Load Balancer\n• Network Load Balancer\n• Classic Load Balancer\nApplication Load Balancer - As its name indiactes, this type works at the application level (L7 in the OSI model) and also provides advanced routing and features. For instance, if you need to load balance web servers working on HTTP/HTTPS and want to make the most of advanced features then you should use the application load balancer. When you setup an application load balancer, you are only provided with its DNS name, but no IP address.\nNetwork Load Balancer - The network load balancer works at the transport level (L4 in the OSI model) and in most cases, is used when high performance is required. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you know you\u0026rsquo;ll get thousands of requests per second, then the network load balancer might be a good option. One advantage, depending on the context, of a network load balancer is that it is provided a static IP address (that will not change).\nClassic Load Balancer - A classic load balancer works both at L4 and L7 of the OSI model, but has limited features.\n"

DNS can be compared to an address book since it is a directory of mappings between names and IP addresses and allows hosts to reach endpoints such as URLs or other machines.\nThe full name of a server or endpoint is made of a hostname and the domain in which it sits. It is called a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) and is used for DNS resolution.\nDNS uses a hierarchy to manage the different types of servers.\nWhen using DNS, the URL or name of a server is read from right to left, the root being the highest in the hierarchy and represented by a \u0026ldquo;.\u0026rdquo;.\nBased on this hierarchy, there are several types of DNS servers:\n The Root servers, which represent the \u0026ldquo;.\u0026rdquo; of a domain The Top Level Domain (TLDs), which are authoritative for .net, .com. .io, etc.. The Authoritative servers, which own specific domains such as google.com, amazon.com, aws-cloudops.com, etc.. The DNS resolvers, which receive DNS queries and handle caching and resolution.  DNS resolution can be either iterative or recursive.\nIn an iterative resolution, the local computer DNS resolver handles the full DNS resolution journey.\nIn a recursive resolution, the DNS resolver/caching server handles the full DNS resolution journey.\nOnce bob.com is resolved, the data will be cached into the local DNS cache so that next time it is queried, the resolution does not need to happen again, until the data expires. The time lenght of a cached resource is called a Time-To-Live (TTL). A TTL is a setting configured on a DNS resource to allow DNS caching.\nThose name/IP mappings stored in DNS servers are called resources or records.\nDNS stores different types of DNS records in its mapping directory, but there are only a few common ones that you will ever used:\n A record (Address) - maps a name to an IP address (i.e. bob.com -\u0026gt; 10.1.1.4) PTR record (Pointer) - maps an IP address to a name (i.e. 10.1.1.4 -\u0026gt; bob.com) CNAME record (Canonical Name) - maps a name t a name (i.e. network.bob.com -\u0026gt; something.else.com) NS record (Name Servers) - indicates the authoritative servers for the domain SOA record (Start of Authority) - provides administrative information about the domain MX record (Mail Exchange) - indicates which mail servers are used to send emails to the domain  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP): DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol and is used to dynamically alloacte IP addresses to clients in a network.\nThe way it works:\n A new client connects to a network The client requests the DHCP server a new IP address in this network The DHCP server leases an IP address to this client for a specific duration When the client disconnects, the IP is released in the DHCP pool. If the client remains and the duration has expired, the lease is renewed.  We call that process, DORA (Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowldge).\nWhen a DHCP server leases an IP address, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t only provide the IP but also information around it such as the router gateway of the network and the DNS servers. In other cases where a client would require other services such as a FTP server for example, this would also be provided in the lease. These additional information are called DHCP Options, and each option corresponds to a number.\nExamples:\n Option 1 = subnet mask Option 3 = router gateway Option 6 = DNS servers Option 51 = lease duration time  "

	"content": "Amazon Route 53 is a Domain Name System (DNS) web service. Route 53 provides three main functions:\n  Domain registration: Route 53 allows you to register a domain name for your website, such as example.com. This domain name can be used by the users to access your website.\n  DNS service: an EC2 instance has an IP address assigned to it (i.e. 10.0.0.42). In order to connect to it, you would need to remember the whole IP address. Route 53 translates domain names, such as example.com, into IP addresses, such as 10.0.0.42. Therefore, you could access your website by using the domain name instead of having to remember the whole IP address. This is the same concept as for traditional networking.\n  Health checking: Route 53 uses health checks to monitor the health of your resources (such as EC2 instances or ELB). Optionally, you can receive notifications when your resources fail the health checks.\n  By default, AWS provides each VPC with a local DNS resolver, the .2 reserved IP address mentionned previously. This resolver allows resources inside the VPC to obtain a DNS name and to query other hosts.\nAs we discussed in Day 1, a DNS resolver is provided by a DHCP set. In AWS, there is a DHCP Option configured by default on each VPC, which contains details about the DNS servers provided by AWS.\nSo, alternatively, if you want to use another DNS server, you can just create a DHCP set with your DNS servers and apply that set to the VPC. In that case, all instances in this VPC will query all DNS requests to this new set of DNS resolvers.\nRoute 53 can route the traffic to the resources following routing policies depending on different needs:\n  Simple routing policy: when you have a single resource, such as a web server that serves a website.\n  Failover routing policy: when you want an active-passive failover.\n  Geolocation routing policy: when you want to route traffic based on the location of your users.\n  Geoproximity routing policy: when you want to route traffic based on the location of your resources.\n  Latency routing policy: when you have resources in multiple AWS Regions and you want to minimize latency.\n  Multivalue answer routing policy: when you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random.\n  Weighted routing policy: when you want to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify.\n  "

	"content": "AWS allows you to integrate your on-premise network with your cloud environment, either:\n by using a Direct Connect connection (DX) by using a Virtual Private Network (VPN)  They can both be used for this purpose but are chosen based on different needs.\nA VPN is an encrypted tunnel going over the Internet. There are two types of VPN in AWS:\n Site-to-Site VPN : this one is used between different sites, such as an on-premise network and the cloud, and uses IPsec type of VPN.   Client VPN : this one allows single clients to connect to specific resources.   Alternatively, if you require different features or use case, you can setup your own VPN instance with a Third Party Software.  AWS Direct Connect allows you to establish a direct connection from on-premise to AWS through a dedicated link.\nThere are several ways to use Direct Connect:\n There are several Direct Connect locations around the world to which you can connect your on-premise routers. You can work with an AWS Partner or a network provider to establish the connection from your on-premise data center to the AWS cloud. You can work with an AWS Partner to get a hosted connection, in which case you only get a slice of an existing Direct Connect link.  When connecting to AWS with Direct Connect, you need to setup a virtual interface to connect to the resources. When connecting to your private resources such as your VPCs, a private virtual interface will be required. When connecting to AWS services, a public virtual inerface will be required since they are considered as public services.\nIn order to use the same existing Direct Connect link to connect to another region, you can use a Direct Connect Gateway. In this case, an interface is created from your existing Direct Connect endpoint to connect to the Gateway, and then the Gateway can connect to the different VPCs in the different regions.\nVPN VS.

	"content": "A company may have multiple VPCs. For example, there could be a VPC for the finance department and another VPC for the legal department. The finance department may want to access resources in the legal department, and vice versa. In that case, yu will need a VPC peering connection.\nA VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that allows you to route traffic between them. Instances from one VPC can communicate with instances from the other VPC as if they are within the same network.\nYou can have multiple VPC peering connections for each VPC. However, you can\u0026rsquo;t establish transitive peering relationships. The following diagram illustrates it. VPC A has two peering connections with both VPC B and VPC C. VPC B and VPC C can\u0026rsquo;t have a peering relationship through VPC A. They should establish a direct VPC peering connection between them in order to do so.\n"

	"content": "VPC peering connections can become complicated when there are too many VPCs trying to communicate, the configuration and management becomes heavy (without also forgetting the VPC peering number limits). In which case, a good practice is to use a Transit Gateway to establish connectivity between the VPCs.\nA Transit Gateway acts like a central router to centralize routing across the different networks such as VPCs and on-premise networks. This component works with VPCs, VPNs and Direct Connect connections. The routing decisions are based on route tables attached to each component at the Transit Gateway.\nThe key terms:\n Attachement Attachment route table Routes  static propagation blackhole    The Transit Gateway route tables work out the way to route traffic, however local network route tables are still required to direct the local traffic to the Transit Gateway for specific destination (like for a router to direct traffic to another router).\n\u0026lt;img src='/images/tgwroutetable.png' width=\u0026lsquo;1000px\u0026gt;\nHaving such routing allows customers to manage their routing centrally but also to centralize other services such as Internet (i.e. picture above), security services, etc.\nIt also becomes convenient when 2 environments living in different regions need to be able to communicate, Transit Gateways can be peered.\n\u0026lt;img src='/images/tgwpeering.png\u0026rsquo; width=\u0026lsquo;800px\u0026gt;\n"

	"content": "As we previsouly mentioned in the Direct Connect section, AWS services are considered \u0026ldquo;public\u0026rdquo; services unless they\u0026rsquo;re setup in a VPC. This means that when an instance is trying to reach an AWS service (such as API Gateway, an S3 bucket, ..), the traffic is going out to the Internet because the service name resolves (DNS) to a public name/URL endpoint.\nThis situation therefore requires Internet access, therefore an Internet Gateway.\nIn some cases, you may not have any Internet access due to architecture requirements or compliance for example, in which case you cannot reach these AWS services.\nA VPC endpoint is a component that allows resources to privately access AWS services, without going through the Internet. There are two types of endpoints: Interface Endpoint and Gateway Endpoint.\n Gateway Endpoint  A Gateway endpoint can be configured for two services only: S3 and Dynamodb.\nThis type of endpoint is setup in the same way as you would setup any other route such as an Internet Gateway or a Transit Gateway. This is just an added route to the subnet route table to point any traffic destined for the service to the VPC endpoint.\nAn Interface endpoint can be configured for all services except Dynamodb.\n Interface Endpoint  The way to connect to this endpoint is not via route table addition, but via an ENI (elastic network interface). When an Interface endpoint gets created, an ENI is automatically created for this endpoint in the same VPC.\nTherefore, because we have seen that all resources within a VPC can route to each other by default, then the Interface endpoint is made available to all resources within the VPC.\n"
