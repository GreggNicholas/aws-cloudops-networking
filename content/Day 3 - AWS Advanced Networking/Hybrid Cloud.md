AWS allows you to integrate your on-premise network with your cloud environment, either:
- by using a Direct Connect connection (DX)
- by using a Virtual Private Network (VPN)

They can both be used for this purpose but are chosen based on needs.

A VPN is an encrypted tunnel going over the Internet. There are two types of VPN in AWS:
- Site to Site VPN : this one is used between different sites, such as an on-premise network and the cloud, and uses IPsec type of VPN.
- Client VPN : this one allows single clients to connect to specific resources.
- Alternatively, if you require different features or use case, you can setup your own VPN instance with a Third Party Software
