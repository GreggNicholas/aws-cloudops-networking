A network can be defined as a group of devices interconnected together via an edge networking component forming a dedicated and private environment.

Let's take an example:

There are several types of networks but the most common are LAN (Local Area Network) and WAN (Wide Area Network). As the names indicate, a LAN is defined by a single network (i.e. your house network) while a WAN allows interconnection between different LANs.

How does it work?

The main devices used in networking are switch and router. They work at different layers and allow connectivity inside and outside a network, respectively. 

In a LAN, a switch allows all devices in its network to connect and communicate. The router sits on the edge of the LAN in order to provide external connectivity, either to the Internet or to an external network.

In a WAN, edge routers of the different LANs connect together to allow their inside LAN to talk to each other. And all of this is done thanks to routing and IP addressing that we will cover in a few sections.

Now that we have the big picture, let's talk about networking layers.
