AWS currently has 24 regions in its [global infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/).
Each of these regions contains at least two Availability Zones. You can think of an Availability Zone as a collection
of one or more physical datacenters. There are 77 Availability Zones throughout the world.

Talk about regions and AZa.
Mention Shared responsibility by relating to OSI model too.
